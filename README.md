# Project-1-Heart-Disease-AI07
Heart Disease Prediction
# Summary
This project targeted to had below criteria:

a. The model should reach at least 90% accuracy for both training and validation.

b. The model should be in good fit (no under or overfitting). When you reach criteria a,
   your model is considered not underfitting already. 
   
# Dataset

The dataset used in this project was dataset from David Lapp 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

# Methodology

First we upload package that needed in this project
Then, we upload the dataset and printed out portion of the data

 Fit the model with training and testing data
 
 # Result
 Plotted the validation accuracy and loss

We get trainining and testing evaluation as shown below
